      <article>
          <p>Hello! This is my first blog post on this website, for a while I've wanted to have my own little place to ramble about all types of stuff, I also wanted some experience in coding websites, so I made this little page. I think the best way to start this blog post is to introduce myself! I'm Tsukki, currently 18 years old, still figuring out what I identify as, so you can call me a she or a he, doesn't really matter much. I love computers, Linux, video games and I like to watch anime and read manga occasionally, yeah, pretty generic stuff huh, but it is what makes me happy.</p>

          <p>Blogs are kinda hard, it's tough coming up with things to talk about, since well, to have topics you need a life, and I have none -- who knew the Linux user doesn't have a life wow --, but I will still try coming up with some topics for this blog, I have somethings I wanna talk about eventually, like my journey with Linux and how I became enamoured with computers all over again, my stance on freedom of software and open-source, and how my playthrough of Shin Megami Tensei III Nocturne is coming along, maybe throw some album reviews here and there too -- forgot to mention that I am a big nerd when it comes to like four or so of my favorite artists and most of them belong to the same group --, it's gonna be fun!</p>

          <p>I hope you can come along for the ride and be here for a moment to hear me rambling, if not, safe travels, but if you can muster the patience and spare the time, I promise I have interesting stuff to talk about.</p>

          <p>So, I coded this website all by myself, no fancy tools, not even javascript involved really -- I hate that language, but I hate CSS more, not gonna lie --, I inspired myself a bit on <a href='https://github.com/stardust-kyun/stardust-kyun.github.io'>Stardust-kyun's</a> own repository for their website and I really liked the simplicity of it, I also saw drainpixie's blog (couldn't find the link, blame her) and thought that I should make one for myself as well, and here we are.</p>

          <p>Writing the code wasn't that hard this time around, even though I barely know about front-end programming, I did what I could and my lackluster CSS skills have finally been proven useful this one time, although I still struggled with, get this, centering a div!!! Criminal! Arrest him! Anyways... the coding went mostly smoothly, the structure for this website was really minimal so I didn't really had much to worry about, this is genuinely the hardest part: making content for it.</p>

          <p>I really like the colorscheme here though, IBM Carbon goes well with anything, it's impressive really, it also fits with my whole system -- which I will show in a future post -- so it is a plus.</p>

          <p>I wish the experience writing the entirety of this website was a little more miserable so I would have more content to write, but for now this is everything, I had fun coding this and I had fun writing this post. Hope you stick around, whoever it is behind the screen, see you later!</p>

          <p>-- Tsukki</p>
